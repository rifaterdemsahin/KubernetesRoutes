It looks like your Ingress resource is correctly defined, but the `ADDRESS` field is empty. This typically means that the Ingress controller hasn't assigned an external IP or hostname to your Ingress resource yet. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### **1. Verify Ingress Controller Status**
Ensure that the Ingress controller is running properly:
```sh
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ingress
```
You should see a pod named something like `ingress-nginx-controller-xxxxx` in the `Running` state. If it's not running, there might be an issue with the Ingress controller setup.

### **2. Check Ingress Controller Logs**
If the Ingress controller pod is running but the `ADDRESS` field is still empty, check the logs for any errors:
```sh
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
```
Look for any error messages that might indicate why the Ingress controller isn't assigning an address.

### **3. Ensure Minikube IP is Correct**
Minikube's Ingress controller typically uses Minikube's IP address. Verify Minikube's IP:
```sh
minikube ip
```
Make sure this IP is correctly mapped to `example.local` in your `/etc/hosts` file:
```sh
echo "$(minikube ip) example.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### **4. Update Ingress Resource**
If the Ingress controller is running but still not assigning an address, try updating your Ingress resource to explicitly specify the Ingress class:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: example.local
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: nginx-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```
Apply the updated Ingress resource:
```sh
kubectl apply -f <your-ingress-file>.yaml
```

### **5. Verify Ingress Resource**
Check the Ingress resource again to see if the `ADDRESS` field is populated:
```sh
kubectl get ingress
```
If the `ADDRESS` field is still empty, there might be an issue with the Ingress controller configuration.

### **6. Test with Minikube IP**
As a temporary workaround, you can test your setup using Minikube's IP directly:
```sh
curl http://$(minikube ip)
```
If this works, it confirms that your Nginx service is running and accessible, but there's an issue with the Ingress resource or controller.

### **7. Restart Minikube**
Sometimes, restarting Minikube can resolve issues with the Ingress controller:
```sh
minikube stop
minikube start
```

### **8. Re-enable Ingress Addon**
If the issue persists, try disabling and re-enabling the Ingress addon:
```sh
minikube addons disable ingress
minikube addons enable ingress
```

### **9. Check Network Policies**
Ensure there are no Network Policies blocking traffic to the Ingress controller or your Nginx service.

### **10. Debug Further**
If none of the above steps work, you may need to debug further by checking the status of the Ingress controller and related resources:
```sh
kubectl describe ingress example-ingress
kubectl describe svc nginx-service
kubectl describe pod <nginx-pod-name>
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with your Ingress resource. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸš€

To access a specific version (version-2) via URL, modify your Ingress resource to include path-based routing:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: example.local
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /version-2(/|$)(.*)
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: nginx-service-v2
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Key changes:
- Added `/version-2(/|$)(.*)` path to match version-2 URL
- `rewrite-target` redirects traffic to the correct service
- Ensure `nginx-service-v2` is the name of your version-2 service

Apply with:
```sh
kubectl apply -f <your-ingress-file>.yaml
```

This configuration allows accessing version-2 via `http://example.local/version-2`.
