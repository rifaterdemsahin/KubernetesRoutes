Certainly! Here's a sample `your-deployment.yaml` file for deploying an Nginx application in a Kubernetes cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

**Explanation:**

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the API version, in this case, `apps/v1`, which is appropriate for deployments.
- **kind**: Indicates that this resource is a `Deployment`.
- **metadata**: Contains the name of the deployment (`nginx-deployment`) and labels (`app: nginx`) for identification.
- **spec**: Defines the desired state of the deployment:
  - **replicas**: Sets the number of pod replicas to 3.
  - **selector**: Defines how to identify pods managed by this deployment using labels.
  - **template**: Specifies the pod template used by the deployment:
    - **metadata**: Labels applied to the pods.
    - **spec**: Details of the containers within the pods:
      - **name**: Name of the container (`nginx`).
      - **image**: Docker image to use (`nginx:1.14.2`).
      - **ports**: Exposes port 80 on the container.

This configuration will create a deployment named `nginx-deployment` that manages three replicas of an Nginx pod, each exposing port 80.
