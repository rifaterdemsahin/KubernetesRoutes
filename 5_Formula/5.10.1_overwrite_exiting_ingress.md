To overwrite an existing Ingress, you have two main approaches:

1. Direct Replacement Method:
```sh
kubectl replace -f your-new-ingress.yaml
```

2. Apply Method (Recommended):
```sh
kubectl apply -f your-new-ingress.yaml
```

Both methods will replace the existing Ingress configuration. The `apply` method is generally preferred as it's more flexible and handles updates more smoothly.

Key tips:
- Ensure the new YAML has the same `name` as the existing Ingress
- Verify all configurations before applying
- Double-check namespace matches the existing Ingress

Here's an alternative Ingress configuration that allows routing to `/version-3` with a different backend service:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: version-3-alternative-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: example.local
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /version-3(/|$)(.*)
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: alternative-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Key modifications:
- Changed `name` to `version-3-alternative-ingress`
- Updated `rewrite-target` to `/$2`
- Modified path to capture more flexible routing
- Used `alternative-service` as backend service name
