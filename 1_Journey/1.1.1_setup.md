4. **Start Minikube**: Once the codespace is running, start Minikube.
5. **Verify Minikube**: Ensure that Minikube is running by checking the nodes.
6. **Deploy Your Application**: Create a Kubernetes deployment and service manifest for your application and apply the manifest using `kubectl`.
7. **Enable Ingress**: Enable the NGINX Ingress controller in Minikube.
8. **Create Ingress Resource**: Create an Ingress resource to manage routing to your application and apply it.
