# Rubber Duck Debugging for Completing the Project

## Introduction
Rubber duck debugging is a method where you explain your code and thought process to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck) to help identify issues and clarify your understanding. Hereâ€™s a guide to using rubber duck debugging for this project.

## Steps

### 1. **Set Up Repository**
- **Explain**: "I need to create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one. This repository will contain all the necessary files and configurations for the project."
- **Question**: "Have I initialized the repository correctly and added all required files?"

### 2. **Configure Codespaces**
- **Explain**: "I need to add a `.devcontainer` directory with configuration files to set up Minikube within Codespaces."
- **Question**: "Are all the configuration files in place and correctly set up?"

### 3. **Launch Codespace**
- **Explain**: "I will open the repository in GitHub and create a new codespace instance."
- **Question**: "Is the codespace instance running without errors?"

### 4. **Start Minikube**
- **Explain**: "I need to start Minikube within the codespace to create a local Kubernetes cluster."
- **Question**: "Is Minikube starting correctly and are there any errors in the process?"

### 5. **Verify Minikube**
- **Explain**: "I will verify that Minikube is running by checking the nodes."
- **Question**: "Are all nodes in the cluster showing as ready?"

### 6. **Deploy Your Application**
- **Explain**: "I need to create Kubernetes deployment and service manifests for my application and apply them using `kubectl`."
- **Question**: "Are the deployment and service manifests correctly defined and applied without errors?"

### 7. **Enable Ingress**
- **Explain**: "I will enable the NGINX Ingress controller in Minikube to manage incoming traffic."
- **Question**: "Is the Ingress controller enabled and running correctly?"

### 8. **Create Ingress Resource**
- **Explain**: "I need to create an Ingress resource to manage routing to my application and apply it."
- **Question**: "Is the Ingress resource correctly defined and applied without errors?"

### 9. **Set Up Port Forwarding**
- **Explain**: "I will set up port forwarding to access the application from my local environment."
- **Question**: "Is port forwarding set up correctly and can I access the application locally?"

### 10. **Modify Ingress Rules**
- **Explain**: "I need to edit the Ingress resource to change routes and serve from different URLs, then apply the updated resource."
- **Question**: "Are the new routes correctly defined and applied without errors?"

### 11. **Verify Changes**
- **Explain**: "I will ensure that the new routes are correctly configured by accessing the updated URLs and checking the Ingress resource status."
- **Question**: "Are the new routes accessible and is the Ingress resource status as expected?"

### 12. **Document the Process**
- **Explain**: "I need to document all steps, commands, and configurations used in the project."
- **Question**: "Is the documentation clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date?"

### 13. **Test and Debug**
- **Explain**: "I will test the application and routing thoroughly and debug any issues that arise."
- **Question**: "Are all tests passing and have all issues been resolved?"

### 14. **Commit and Push Changes**
- **Explain**: "I need to commit all changes to the repository and push them to GitHub."
- **Question**: "Are all changes committed and pushed without conflicts?"

### 15. **Review and Refine**
- **Explain**: "I will review the entire setup and configuration and refine any steps or configurations as needed."
- **Question**: "Is the setup optimized and are there any areas for improvement?"

### 16. **Share and Collaborate**
- **Explain**: "I will share the repository with collaborators and ensure the setup is reproducible for others."
- **Question**: "Is the repository accessible to collaborators and is the setup reproducible?"

### 17. **Maintain and Update**
- **Explain**: "I need to regularly update the repository with any new changes or improvements."
- **Question**: "Is the repository maintained and are all configurations current?"

By following these steps and explaining each part of the process to your rubber duck, you can identify potential issues and ensure a thorough understanding of the project.
